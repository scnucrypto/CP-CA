# Chosen-Plaintext Computation Analysis

This repository is related to the paper **Unboxing ARX-Based White-Box Ciphers: Chosen-Plaintext Computation Analysis and Its Applications** published by Yufeng Tang, Zheng Gong, Liangju Zhao, Di Li, and Zhe Liu in TCHES Volume 2024, Issue 3.

This repository contains the source code for the Chosen-Plaintext Computation Analysis against Self-Equivalence and Implicit white-box SPECK and CRAX implementations.

The target white-box implementations are generated with [self-equivalence white-box arx framework](https://github.com/jvdsn/white-box-speck) and [implicit white-box arx framework](https://github.com/ranea/whiteboxarx). The implicit white-box implementations are compiled with the support of [M4RI](https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri). The random affine encodings in the simulation are generated by [WBMatrix](https://github.com/scnucrypto/WBMatrix).

Each folder of the attack instance has its corresponding README. The ".txt" file in the folder records the attack results. If the executive outcome is equal (or similar) to the content in the txt file, it implies a successful reproduced result.
